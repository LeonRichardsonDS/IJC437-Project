# IJC437-Project
**The first piece of coursework I completed on my MSc Data Science.**

The project investigated differences in economic performance within Yorkshire and the Humber, using data on the number of enteprises (businesses) and employees from 2009-2022. 

The performance of 21 areas that covered Yorkshire and the Humber was compared and modelled.

### Key findings
 - Wide variation in the change in enterprise and employment numbers across the region. 
 - Generally, business numbers increased more than employment numbers, but the two were somewhat related.
 - Larger towns and cities generally performed better.

### Enterprise Growth
 - Areas with more employees and enterprises generally had greater increases in enterprise numbers.
 - Areas with less agriculture generally had a greater increase in enterprise numbers too.

### Issues
 - The same could not be said for employment numbers, which were more unpredictable on an area-by-area level.
 - The models could fully explain enteprise growth. This is partly due to outliers, such as Doncaster which showed exceptional enterpise growth for its size and Leeds, which had by far the largest population.
